# Accessibility Statement
{class="pl-4 py-3 border-l-12 light:border-eggplant dark:border-hunyadi-yellow"}

This website is created and maintained by me, Alex Karp. I am committed to making this site accessible, functional, and delightful for as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities, technology, or accessibility needs. Accessibility is a core value in my design and development process.

## Standards and Compliance

I have designed and tested this website to be fully compliant with [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines help ensure that digital content is accessible to people with diverse disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. This site aims to meet or exceed Level AA compliance as of the date below.

## Features

To enhance usability and accessibility:
- The website is fully navigable using a keyboard.
- Text content is written in plain, straightforward language.
- Images include descriptive alt text for assistive technologies.
- The design ensures sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.
- The site is fully functional on modern assistive technologies, including screen readers.

## Javascript Use

This site uses a small amount of Javascript to add a touch of fun: the animation delays on the candle flames are randomized. However, this functionality is non-essential, and the site's core content and features remain accessible even if Javascript is disabled in your browser.

## Commitment to Improvement

Accessibility is an ongoing process, and I am always looking to improve. If you encounter an issue or have suggestions for making this site more inclusive, please don't hesitate to contact me at [hanukkah@alexkarp.net](mailto:hanukkah@alexkarp.net). Feedback is always welcome, and I appreciate your help in making this site better for everyone.

## Published Date

This statement is effective as of January 9, 2025.
